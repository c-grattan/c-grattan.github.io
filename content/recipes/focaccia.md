Dissolve yeast in the water, which should be above room temperature (I go for as hot as my hot tap will allow), starting with a small amount of water to produce a slurry - then diluting it with the rest of the water.

Add oil to the yeasty water.

Combine the flour and salt, then add to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. Mix until roughly homogenous.

Cover the bowl (ideally with something non-absorbent, to reduce drying) and allow the dough to ferment for 2 hours. Check in every half hour, stretching and folding the dough over itself until taught each time.

After the last stretch and fold, place the dough onto a generously-oiled baking tray. Leave it to rest whilst the oven preheats to it's maximum temperature ({{ $doc.temp[0] }} for me).

Gently stretch the dough out across the baking tray, creating dimples by pushing down on it with the tips of your fingers. Be careful to pop as few air bubbles as possible. Make sure the tray has enough oil, the dough should be able to easily slide across the entire area of it.

Drizzle some olive oil on top of the dough, and massage it into every nook - the dough should be completely coated and have little puddles of oil between the bubbles and dimples.

Put the tray with the dough in the oven for 10 minutes at that maximum temperature, before lowering it to {{ $doc.temp[1] }} for the remaining 15 minutes.

Remove and allow the dough to cool for at least an hour before slicing. This will allow evaporated moisture to re-absorb into the dough, making it less dry.
