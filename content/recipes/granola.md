recipeTitle: Granola
---
Mix the liquid ingredients together in a bowl (nut butter, honey, vanilla extract, salt, and chia seeds)

Incorporate the remaining ingredients. Mix until homogenous, everything should clump together nicely and have no loose oats, seeds, etc.

Prepare a baking tray with greased greaseproof paper, or a silpat, and spread the mixture across it. Try to keep large solids like nuts away from the edges, to maintain structual integrity of the clumps in the final product.

Put the mix in a non-preheated oven, set to {{ $doc.temp[0] }}, and bake for 20 minutes. Remove halfway through baking and re-mix to ensure even cooking.

Leave to cool for at least an hour. Ideally you make this at the end of the day, have it cool overnight, and then enjoy it in the morning.

Break the sheet of granola into clumps of your preferred size, then mix in the extras.
