Freeze the chocolate to make it brittle, then powderise in a food processor.

Add the remaining ingredients, and continue to blitz until the grains are roughly uniform in size.

To make hot chocolate, whisk 1 parts powder into 8 parts hot milk (two tablespoons powder to a mug of milk), then gently heat the mix for a minute or two longer to thicken.

To make chocolate pudding, mix 1 parts cornstarch and 4 parts powder - whisk this into 16 parts hot milk (1 tablespoon cornstarch, 4 tablespoons powder, 1 mug milk) and heat as above. Leave this to cool in whatever container you wish to serve in, then leave it all to chill in a fridge for at least 6 hours. If finished product is not thick enough for your liking, add more cornstarch (try an extra teaspoon).
