Dissolve yeast in the water, which should be warm/hot.

Mix in the yoghurt.

Combine the flour & salt, then add to the rest of the ingredients. Combine into a homogenous mix. If you are adding extras (e.g. nigella seeds), this is the time to do so.

Cover (ideally with something non-absorbent) and let ferment/hydrate for an hour.

Knead until firm, ~15 mins. Adding only as much flour as necessary to keep from becoming a sticky mess - do not pre-flour your workspace.

Cover & let ferment for an hour again.

Divide the dough into as many pieces as you are serving, coating them with flour & flattening into a naan-bread-esque shape.

Cook each piece in a hot, dry, pan for a few minutes on both sides - try to get some charring in a few spots whilst still cooking the whole thing through.

Ideally the previous step should NOT be in a non-stick pan, since we are aiming for temperatures that would damage the coating. If you only have a non-stick pan just go low and slow, accepting that the result might not be 'authentic'. Whatever that means.
