This recipe requires filtering at several steps. At each step you can use either a fine mesh sieve, or a cheesecloth, but ideally both.

Soak the oats in water, just enough to cover (not the water listed in the ingredients), anywhere from 8 hours to overnight.

Filter the oats from the soaking water, and blend them with the fresh water (the water listed in the ingredients).

Filter this mixture into a container, to remove the larger oat particles, and store it in the fridge.
