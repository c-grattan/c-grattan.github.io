Seperate the egg whites from the yolks, and put each into a seperate bowl. Whisk the whites to stiff peaks.

Add the milk, salt, sugar, and butter to the yolks. Stir to combine.

Add enough of the flour to the yolk mixture to get a batter consistency slightly drier than what you'd like (to account for the moistening that will occur when the whites get added).

Add the whipped egg whites to the yolk mixture, folding them in to combine.

Heat a dry non-stick pan to a medium heat, and add a single pancake's worth of batter to it. Cook on the first side for a few minutes, then flip and cook the other side as well. If making pancakes with blueberries, add them immediately before flipping to prevent them overcooking/turning to mush.

Relocate the pancake to a stack, and repeat above step until batter is depleted.

Allow the stack of pancakes to rest for at least 10 minutes. This ensures the pancakes finish cooking and allows them to absorb some of the trapped steam which will improve the texture.
